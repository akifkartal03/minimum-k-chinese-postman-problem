### Problem Definition

- Given a multigraph G = (V , E) initial vertex s ∈ V length l(e) ∈ N for each e ∈ E the minimum k-Chinese postman problem is to find k tours(cycles) such that each containing the initial vertex s and each edge of the graph has been traversed at least once and the most expensive tour is minimized.
